"To adjust the cooking time when cooking more than 4 pork chops at once, it's important to consider the thickness of the chops and ensure they are cooked through properly. Generally, you should follow these steps:

1. **Check Thickness**: If the pork chops are thicker, they may require a longer cooking time; conversely, thinner chops may cook faster.
2. **Cook in Batches**: If your cooking method (like frying in a pan) doesn't allow for all chops to fit without overcrowding, consider cooking them in batches to ensure even cooking.
