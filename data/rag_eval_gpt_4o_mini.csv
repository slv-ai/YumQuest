"To achieve a crispier Rösti, you can follow these tips based on the cooking process outlined in the recipe:

1. **Shred Potatoes Properly**: Use a grater to shred the raw or cooked potatoes into large shreds rather than fine ones. This helps create a better texture.

2. **Use High Heat Initially**: Start by heating up some butter in a large pan and cook the potato mixture on high heat for the first few minutes. This will help form a crust faster.

3. **Thickness Matters**: Form the Rösti into a round cake about 1 to 1.5 cm thick. A thinner Rösti may get crispier compared to a thicker one.

4. **Add Butter During Cooking**: Flake additional butter around the edges of the Rösti in the pan to help with crisping as it cooks.

6. **Flip Gently**: When it's time to flip the Rösti, use a plate to assist. This method helps maintain the shape and allows both sides to crisp evenly.
