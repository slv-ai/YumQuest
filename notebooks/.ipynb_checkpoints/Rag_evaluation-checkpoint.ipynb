This recipe is a spin of the classical mashed potatoes recipe that's got itself more going on. You can serve this dish for a relatively light meal, or you can also serve it as a side dish if you want to have a really hearty meal.\",\n",

If you are planning on eating this as a side dish, it might be more like 6-8 portions. * 1kg potatoes * 200ml milk* * 200ml mayonnaise* * ~100g cheese * Garlic powder * 12-16 strips of bacon * Butter * 3-4 green onions * Black pepper * Salt  *You can play with the proportions depending on how creamy or dry you want the mashed potatoes to be.',\n",
       " 'direction': '1. Peel and cut the potatoes into medium sized pieces. 2. Put the potatoes in a pot with some water so that it covers the potatoes and   boil them for about 20-30 minutes, or until the potatoes are soft. 3. About ten minutes before removing the potatoes from the boiling water, cut   the bacon into little pieces and fry it. 4. Warm up the milk and mayonnaise. 5. Shred the cheese. 6. When the potatoes are done, remove all water from the pot, add the warm milk   and mayonnaise mix, add some butter, and mash with a potato masher or a   blender. 7. Add some salt, black pepper and garlic powder to taste and continue mashing   the mix. 8. Once the mix is somewhat homogeneous and the potatoes are properly mashed,   add the shredded cheese and fried bacon and mix a little. 9. Serve and top with chopped green onions.'}"

This allows for more surface area to crisp up.\\n3. **Heat Management**: Start cooking on high heat to develop a crust, and after browning, reduce to medium-low to cook through without burning.\\n4. **Butter**: Add butter flakes around the inside of the pan to help crisp the underside of the Rösti.\\n5. **Cooking Time**: Be patient; it can take some time for a crust to form. Check for browning after approximately 5-10 minutes.\\n6. **Thickness**: For a crispier Rösti, consider limiting the thickness to around 1 cm, as thicker layers may not crisp up as well.\\n7. **Flipping**: When flipping the Rösti, use a plate to help, which can prevent it from breaking and ensures even cooking on both sides.\\n\\nFollowing these tips should help achieve a crispier texture for your Rösti!', {'Relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'Explanation': 'The generated answer is highly relevant to the question, providing detailed and practical tips on how to achieve a crispier Rösti.
